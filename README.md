This repository contains all the deliverables of our final project, linked together through a single python script. With this we aim to show everything we have learned throughout the semester.
The different codes we develop perform basic cybersecurity tasks; and were developed in different programming languages ​​with the intention of adapting to different operating systems.

Table of contents:
-Powershell:
  -Check file hash with VirusTotal
  -List hidden files
  -View system resource usage
  -Check suspicious processes
-Bash
  -network monitoring
  -penetration testing
Python:
  -Metadata extration
  -Ransomware file
  -shodan
  -vulnerability headers
